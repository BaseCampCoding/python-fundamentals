# Rewrite List!

For this assignment you will rewrite a bunch of list methods only using a few select
operations.

Things You Can Do:
- For loop over a list

```python
for x in l:
    ...
```

- `+` lists together

```python
list1 + list2
```

- create a new list literal

```python
[1, 2, 3]
```

- get an element at an index

```python
list[3]
```

- Use list functions you have written! After you write a function,
you can use it to help write other functions!

This means:

- *You cannot `list.append`*
- *You cannot slice*
- *You cannot do anything to the list that isn't one of the five listed things!*
