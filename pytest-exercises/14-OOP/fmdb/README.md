# Fake Movie Database

You've been given a completed `disk.py`, `shell.py`, and `test_core.py` for a fake movie
database application. Your job is to implement the classes described by the
tests in `test_core.py`. Once you've done that, you should be able to run
`shell.py` and browse the movies loaded from `movie_metadata.csv`.

## BONUS

I've also included a file named `web.py`. Running this file `python3 web.py` should start
a web app on your laptop so that you can look at the movies in your browser. You can view
the web app by going to `localhost:5000` in google chrome.

*This web app uses the same `disk.py` and `core.py` as `shell.py`*

Hopefully, this provides a fun peek into what the rest of the year will grow into.
