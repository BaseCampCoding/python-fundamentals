# War

Write a program that allows 2 users to play the card game war
(https://pagat.com/war/war.html#two). If you haven't played this game before,
it will be helpful to play a few games yourself. **You can't teach/program something
that you don't understand.**

Once you've successfully implemented 2-player war. You will quickly realize that
war can take forever to play. Add an option for the user to "save and quit".
Also, when starting up the game, you should add an option for the user to
load an existing game **if one exists**.
